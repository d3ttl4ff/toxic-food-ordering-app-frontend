# `CozmicEats` Food Ordering Web App

CozmicEats is a food ordering web app that allows users to order food from a variety of restaurants. Users can `create an account`, `browse restaurants`, `view menus`, and `place orders`. The app also includes a feature that allows users to `track orders` in real-time. The app uses `Stripe API` for payment processing and `MongoDB` for data storage.

> [!NOTE]\
> The food items and the theme of the app are fictional and they are based on medieval and fantasy themes. Some might find them humorous or distasteful 🫠. But don't worry, the app is intended for demonstration purposes only. And for FUN!
